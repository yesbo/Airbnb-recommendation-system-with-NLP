Major plus, Michael’s bed was to die for and many convenient stores in the area as well. Just a slight downside for my fellow women, there’s catcalling left and right once you step out of the apartment, but if you keep your earphones handy, you’ll be alright!Michael war sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich.

       "'Tenho que deixar registrado minha imensa satisfação em ter ficado hospedado na casa do Ryan e da Manú. A casa é exatamente como consta nas fotos, contudo a surpresa vem no capricho, cuidado e limpeza que só são possíveis constatar ao vivo. Manú sempre muito prestativa, muito antes da data do check in sempre manteve contato enviando vídeos descrevendo como utilizar os equipamentos da cozinha, peças do banheiro, entre outras coisas. O bairro é super residencial e fica menos de 5 minutos andando da estação de metrô que leva a Manhattam. Muitos mercadinhos por perto, inclusive 24 horas. Só tenho a dizer que vivi momentos mágicos em Nova Iorque, e parte disso devo à Manu e Ryan que proporcionaram conforto e segurança para mim e para o Lucas na nossa viagem. Esperamos retornar em breve hehe!Quando vc viaja p NY uma das coisas mais complicadas é a hospedagem. Ou é caro demais ou não atende os seus requisitos como  privacidade, limpeza, proximidade do metrô, Wi-Fi grátis, hospitalidade do anfitrião, etc... e foi tudo isso e muito mais que nos fez escolher o room da casa da Manu e do Ryan. Melhor custo beneficio p NY.  Obrigado mais uma vez pela hospitalidade e até a próxima.'"
